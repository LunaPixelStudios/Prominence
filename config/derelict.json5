	     FAST: Best performance, doesn't have an effect on the emitted light level
	     FANCY: Affects emitted light, worse performance. Best option to use with custom texture packs
	     FABULOUS: Affects emitted light, looks the best, slightly worse performance than fancy. Best option for vanilla textures
	   
	   Note: - When switching from FAST to FANCY/FABULOUS, all existing flickering light blocks will have to be replaced in order for the change to take place.
	         - Consider using FAST if you're hosting a server with a lot of players, or if any of the players might be sensitive to flickering lights.
